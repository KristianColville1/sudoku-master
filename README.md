## Deployment
### Version Control
I used [Visual Studio Code] as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub]() as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [sudoku-master]().
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.
    - git add (name of file) *This selects the file for the commit*
    - git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)" *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - git push *The final command sends the code to GitHub*
