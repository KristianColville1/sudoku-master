## Deployment
### Version Control
I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [sudoku-master](https://github.com/KristianColville1/sudoku-master).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

    - git add (name of file) *This selects the file for the commit*
    - git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)" *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - git push *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### GitHub Pages
When I finished setting up my workstation and getting everything set up to use the repository I decided to deploy the website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a resource developers can use to test how their websites behave on a cloud platform. It's an excellent resource provided by GitHub to publicly display websites.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.

### Cloning this Repository
In order to clone this repository for use on your local machine please follow the below steps.

1. Navigate to the repository you wish to clone.
2. Click the green button labelled 'Code'.
3. Copy the URL under the HTTPS option.
4. Open an [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) of your choosing that has [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
5. Then open a new terminal in your IDE.
6. Type this exactly: git clone the-URL-you-copied
7. Hit enter.

You now have a local copy of this repository to use on your machine.
