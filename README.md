## Deployment
### Version Control
I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [sudoku-master](https://github.com/KristianColville1/sudoku-master).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

    - git add (name of file) *This selects the file for the commit*
    - git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)" *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - git push *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### GitHub Pages
When I finished setting up my workstation and getting everything set up to use the repository I decided to deploy the website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a resource developers can use to test how their websites behave on a cloud platform. It's an excellent resource provided by GitHub to publicly display websites.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.
